# Tableau Dashboard – Advanced Visualization Showcase

This Tableau workbook (`u4.twbx`) is a collection of advanced visualizations built on the Superstore dataset. The goal is to go beyond basic bar charts and show how richer visual design can uncover patterns in sales, profit, and customer behavior.

## 🔍 What the Workbook Includes

The workbook is organized into four themes:

### 1. Trends & Density
- Dot and jitter plots for 2024 manufacturer sales  
- Quarterly sales trends and sparklines (2021–2024)

**Purpose:** Reveal subtle differences between manufacturers and highlight long-term patterns that a simple bar chart would hide.

### 2. Change Over Time
- Slope graphs for year-over-year margin changes  
- Lollipop charts for 2024 sub-category performance  
- Bullet charts comparing segment profit vs. target

**Purpose:** Quickly show which products and segments are improving, declining, or missing goals.

### 3. Flows & Relationships
- Sankey diagrams:
  - Region → Sub-Category → Profit  
  - Category → Shipping Mode → Region

**Purpose:** Visualize how revenue and profit “flow” through regions, product types, and shipping choices.

### 4. Advanced Visuals
- Stream graph of regional profit over 12 quarters  
- Radial chart of manufacturer profitability

**Purpose:** Compare many entities at once while still keeping the big picture clear.
