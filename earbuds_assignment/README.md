# Earbuds Case – Python Decision Model

This project converts a written business case about wireless earbuds into a reusable Python script. It demonstrates how to translate narrative problems into structured logic that supports quick scenario testing.

## 🧠 Problem Summary
A company is evaluating pricing, demand, or cost decisions for a new earbuds product. Instead of solving the scenario once on paper, this script:
- Encodes the logic in plain Python  
- Allows quick parameter changes  
- Produces consistent and repeatable outputs
